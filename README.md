### Description

This app is built using the Next.js framework with Tailwind CSS for styling. I also installed [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to help with API calls.

I created this project to work with the TMDB API and to see what functionality I could provide to users to provide some quick features to view top20 movies and allow users to quickly search some movies and get some details back.


### Features
The home page features links to each page including, Search and Top 20's. There is a navbar and a footer on each page providing some functionaility but it will include more functionality in the future.

On the search page you will see a search function where you can search for a movie and get the top five movies with descriptions. Future functionality will include clickable links which will give more information about the movie and ratings.

On the top 20's page you can see the top 20 movies on TMDB for the genre you select. The genres are preloaded using the API.

The upcoming page will feature Actor pairing where you will be able to select actors/actresses and see what movies they have been in together.
